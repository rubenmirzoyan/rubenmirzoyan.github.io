    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve been tutoring chemistry for years, starting with over 300 hours as part of an instructor-endorsed peer tutoring program at the University of Toronto. I know high school and undergraduate chemistry—general, organic, physical, inorganic, analytical—like the back of my hand. For every session, I tailor the material to your weak spots so we can make the most of our time together. Whether you need regular support or last-minute prep before an exam, I’ve got you covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in high school, I placed in the top 10 nationally on chemistry contests like the University of Waterloo's Avogadro and Chem 13 News competitions, and I was a top 10 finalist in the Canadian Chemistry Olympiad after rounds of rigorous theoretical and lab exams. I was the only finalist from a public school—and I owe a lot to a high school teacher who sparked my love for chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with people from all backgrounds, and I take your time seriously. Every session is meant to give you real value, clarity, and momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not doing this just to earn money—I’m doing it because I’m genuinely good at it, and I love seeing students go from confused to confident. If you’re not satisfied with a session, I’ll refund you. Simple as that.
